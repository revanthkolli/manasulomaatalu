<h1> A Bit About the Writer </h1>
<br>
<p>
  You might be reading this blog and find yourself with a strong urge to identify who must be a genius behind these posts.

  Or, you might be wondering who this silly guy is who thinks he can write and is obsessed with South Indian cinema.

  I’m hoping you’re in the first category, but either way, my name is Revanth and I’m a bilingual Computer Science student at the University of Virginia. I specify bilingual because even though I grew up in the U.S., I was born in Andhra Pradesh, India and strongly identify with Telugu culture, especially when it comes to movies and music. Always immersing myself in films and songs and dabbling in various forms of art, including acting, writing, songwriting and drawing, I often find myself having a lot on my mind.

  That’s why I started this blog. It’s more of an avenue for me to organize my thoughts, but if you read through and find something you like, feel free to follow via email or like the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ManasuloMaatalu" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>!
