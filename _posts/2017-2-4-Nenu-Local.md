title: Nenu Local
description: Your Average Telugu Rom Com
excerpt: With a thoroughly exhausted plot and lack of logical flow, <i>Nenu Local</i> fails to distinguish itself from the slew of recent Telugu romantic comedies, making it watchable only for Nani's natural performance, Devi Sri Prasad's melodies and some well-penned dialogues.

    <div class="block-title">CRITICAL OVERVIEW</div>
    <br>
    With a thoroughly exhausted plot and lack of logical flow, <i>{{ page.title }}</i> fails to distinguish itself from the slew of recent Telugu romantic comedies, making it watchable only for Nani's natural performance, Devi Sri Prasad's melodies and some well-penned dialogues.

<div class="block">
    <div class="block-title">SYNOPSIS</div>
    <br> Babu (Nani) finally graduates with a degree in Engineering after the help of a frustrated exam proctor and refuses to think about the future. While idly hanging out with his friends, he is confronted by Keerthi (Keerthy Suresh) who mistakes him for an eve teaser who had been harrasing her friend. Soon after the misunderstanding is cleared, Babu announces his love for her and beings to stalk and annoy her in an effort to gain her affection. What he doesn't realize, however, is that the key to gaining her hand in marriage is through her father's approval.

<div class="block">
    <div class="block-title">WHAT WORKED</div>
    <br>&nbsp; &ndash; Nani's performance is naturally charming as usual and he seems to have worked on his dancing skills for the film. He delivers the emotional and comedic dialogues with equal ease. 
    <br><br>&nbsp; &ndash; Keerthy Suresh is cute and has more scope for emotion in <i>{{ page.title }}</i> than in her debut film, <i>Nenu Sailaja</i>.
    <br><br>&nbsp; &ndash; Dialogues are well written and somewhat elevate the routine scenes.
    <br><br>&nbsp; &ndash; Babu's relationship with his parents (Posani Murali Krishna & Easwari Rao) is entertaining. 
    <br><br>&nbsp; &ndash; Devi Sri Prasad's music is a hit, with Next Enti and Arere Yekkada being two of the most popular numbers of the album. 
</div>
<div class="block">
    <div class="block-title">WHAT DIDN'T</div>
    <br>&nbsp; &ndash; The plot is entirely too familiar for a Telugu audience. 
    <br><br>&nbsp; &ndash; Some of the scenes don't have a consistent flow of logic and it isn't explained how Babu has such a strong local presence for being someone who struggled to pass Engineering and hasn't done anything for the people.
    <br><br>&nbsp; &ndash; It isn't explained why Babu refused to get a decent paying job. Sure, love is important, but so is financial stability. These types of sentiments are misguided, because taking care of those you love is a responsibility.
