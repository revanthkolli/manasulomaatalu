For those of us who are lucky to have fathers who have helped guide us when we were lost and taught us some of life's greatest lessons, Father's Day is just one extra reason to celebrate their roles in our lives.

On this occasion, I've put together a list of some of the most touching father child relationships I've seen in recent Telugu cinema.

<strong><span style="color:#808080;">Note: The characters and films are organized into categories and then ordered based on the release dates of the movies that they are from. There is no relative ordering between the films and the list is not exhaustive; it is a list of the ten most touching and realistic father sentiment scenes from the films that I’ve seen in the last decade or so.</span> </strong>

<h3>Bommarillu</h3>

Probably one of the most famous scenes in the past decade of Telugu cinema, Bommarillu's climax shows the struggle between the a father's overbearing love for his son and a son's struggle between independence and his father's happiness.
<h3>Aakasamantha</h3>

A beautiful scene that depicts a father's struggle of accepting a choice his daughter makes that he never expected, knowing that she has grown into a strong woman through the values that he has taught her.
<h3>Darling</h3>

Prabhas and Prabhu have such cute father/son dynamic in Darling and the feelings climax in this scene where the son gives up his love for his father.

<h3>Nenu Sailaja</h3>

A father has a lot of responsibilities and it might be hard to understand the sacrifices he might have to make in order to keep his family satisfied. Nenu Sailaja highlights these sacrifices but also cautions the damage that distance can create in the relationship between a father who leaves his family to help sustain them and a daughter who misses her father dearly and is disappointed by his continual absence in her life.

<h3>Kotha Bangaru Lokam</h3>
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fvwv0zDigEE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Kotha Bangaru Lokam depicts a father who believes in showing love to his son and letting his love, rather than harsh words, help guide him towards making the right decisions.
<h3>Surya S/O Krishnan</h3>

A father's wisdom can guide us when we are most lost; Surya S/O Krishnan shows this simple concept in a wonderfully directed emotional journey as a son recounts his father's influence in the major decisions of his life.
<h3>Nannaku Prematho</h3>
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NJuMHmREzpY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Devi Sri Prasad nailed the emotion needed in this song as a son making a tribute to the loss of the man who has helped shape his life and to whom he is forever indebted to.

<h3>Amma Nanna O Tamil Ammayi</h3>
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qdunzFQJX_8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

While Prakash Raj doesn't start off as a very good father, the development in the bond between Ravi Teja and Prakash Raj shows that a father can be the very coach we need to succeed in our lives.
<h3>Aadavari Maatalaku Ardhale Verule</h3>
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tnoi0Hkn7FQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

While this scene only shows the arguments between a father pushing his son to succeed and a son who is desperately trying, other scenes in Aadavari Maatalaku Ardhale Verule show how much a father can secretly care for and be proud of his child, despite the way he behaves on the surface.
<h3>Raghuvaran B. Tech</h3>
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T4RVXcT_Q0I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This scene in Raghuvaran B. Tech focuses on the loss of a son's mother, but also highlights a father's love for his son as they share a mutual loss. While the father in this movie is distant and sometimes harsh, this scene proves that hardships only help make relationships stronger.
