<h2><span class="review_header">Katha, Screenplay, Darsakathvam</span></h2>
<span style="color:#808080;">I don’t believe in spoiling the plot of a film before watching it. If you haven’t seen the movie yet and would like to know the plot, you can read more about it <a style="color:#808080;" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5684466/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl" target="_blank">here</a>.</span>

With A Aa, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivikram_Srinivas" target="_blank">Trivikram</a> once again proves his mettle as a writer and director. Trivikram delivers a commercial story with family drama and romance that we've seen before, but adds just enough of his own flair in the form of witty dialogues and moving emotions between the soundly developed characters to make it refreshing. Anasuya's (Samantha Ruth Prabhu) narration of the story grabs the audience's attention immediately and masterfully keeps it as the film moves forward at a naturally slow pace. To ensure the smooth transitions and pacing of the film, Trivikram fills the movie with his brand of amusing comedy that keeps the audience satisfied and ensures that they leave with a smile on their faces. There are a few comic scenes of the film that seem a little stretched though, and better editing might have helped fix this issue. Nevertheless, they don't occur often and, therefore, don't take away too much from the movie's strengths.
<h2><span class="review_header">Performances</span></h2>
<h3>Samantha</h3>
Samantha plays Anasuya Ramalingam, a rich, yet depressed young woman who struggles with her relationship with her mother, played by Nadhiya. The entire film centers around Anasuya as she narrates her story and Samantha's portrayal makes the character lovable and relatable.
<h3>Nithin</h3>
Nithin plays Aanand Vihari, or Nandu, a young man who runs a small cooking contracting company, and he depicts the different aspects (comedy, romance, drama, action) of the character well. While Nithin may still be considered a small actor in comparison to other more prominent figures in the industry, he does a great job in showing the nuances of Nandu's character in a vibrant light despite the fact that the story circles around Anasuya's narration.
<h3>Nadhiya</h3>
Nadhiya plays the strict, misunderstood mother of Anasuya and does so aptly. This character is similar to her character in Attarintiki Daredi, so she slips into the role easily.
<h3>Rao Ramesh</h3>
Rao Ramesh plays a rich, calculating neighbor in Aanand's village with some negative shades and comic dialogues that keep the audience in a light mood, even in the dramatic sequences.
<h3>Others</h3>
Naresh is perfect in the film as the fun, loving father of Anasuya who balances her relationship with her mother. Anupama Parameshwaran makes her debut in the Telugu film industry in this film as Rao Ramesh's character's daughter. While her character is nothing new, her portrayal is still entertaining and well done, considering she did her own dubbing for the film too. Ananya (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engaeyum_Eppothum" target="_blank">Journey</a>) does a decent portrayal of Aanand's sister. Srinivas Avasarala has a small role as Anasuya's goofy, timid suitor and is adequate.

As I mentioned in my <a href="http://manasulomaatalu.com/2016/05/31/5-things-that-are-exciting-about-a-aa/" target="_blank">previous article</a>, Mickey J Meyer has provided a soundtrack for this film that is a perfect package. The songs are all well placed and fun to watch on screen. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySo5O2waS9o" target="_blank">Rang De</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFj_RbKIzZ0" target="_blank">Anasuya Kosam</a> are my personal favorites from the album.
<h3>Cinematography</h3>

A Aa has some beautiful visuals to display, from the rich urban house to the beautiful village scenery. The cinematographer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natarajan_Subramaniam" target="_blank">Natarajan Subramaniam</a>, has some big movies in his credentials (Jab We Met, Love Aaj Kal and Raanjhanna to name a few), and it seems like he has put forth his best efforts for this film as well.

<h2><span class="review_header">Final Verdict</span></h2>
While the film boasts nothing extraordinary, A Aa comes with a complete package of entertainment and emotion that helps it consistently score well in all of the aspects that make an enjoyable film. Some better editing might have helped, but regardless, this is one of the better Telugu film's to release in a while this year, so go to the theater folks!
<h3>Parent's Verdict</h3>
For the most part, clean entertainment that is suitable for children, if they can understand the dialogues.
