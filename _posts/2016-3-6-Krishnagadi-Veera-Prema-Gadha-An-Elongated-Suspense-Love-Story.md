<p style="text-align: left;">Nani is an underrated actor in Telugu cinema who has done a number of versatile roles over the years. His last film, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhale_Bhale_Magadivoy" target="_blank">Bhale Bhale Magadivoy</a>, did wonders at the box office and gave him the recognition he truly deserved as an actor with both great comic timing and emotional depth in his expressions. I'm a fan of a number of his movies, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ala_Modalaindi" target="_blank">Ala Modalaindi</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilla_Zamindar">Pilla Zamindar</a>, so I was thrilled to learn that his latest movie was still playing in theaters when I came home for spring break.</p>

<span style="color: #808080;">I don't believe in spoiling the plot of a film before watching it. If you would like to read more about the plot of Krishnagadi Veera Prema Gadha, you can do so <a style="color: #808080;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna_Gaadi_Veera_Prema_Gaadha#Plot" target="_blank">here</a>.</span>

While the love story is nothing new, the way the relationship is portrayed and the comedy that results is entertaining. The inclusion of multiple twists and suspense in the story line maintains the overall pace of the movie though certain scenes do seem unnecessary and boring. Editing out more scenes in the film would have helped decrease the run-time and keep the movie crisp.

The screenplay reminded me of Express Raja, where seemingly unrelated events interlink later on, so pay attention to all of the details!

<h3>Nani</h3>
Nani runs this movie with his expressions and comic timing, but even his charm couldn't help at the times when the film tested my patience. His chemistry with Mehreen worked out really well, which is very important for this film as the love story justifies his actions and character transformation.
<h3>Mehreen</h3>
Mehreen was a good debut; there wasn't anything special, but she did justice to her role and I was glad to see that the director had developed quirks in her character because the story doesn't really demand much of her. It was fresh to see a stubborn and strong-mouthed female character who didn't get annoying and her catchphrase "Chepana, nenu chepana" didn't seem forced (as its counterparts did in Venkatadri Express and Subramanyam for Sale).
<h3>Sampath Raj</h3>
Sampath has a good amount of screen time as the rule-breaking ACP and delivers. His character is believable and powerful for a majority of the film.
<h3>The Kids</h3>
Moksha, Pratham and Naini are very cute and have some nice dialogues and scenes in the film, but the way in which their characters transform and get more attached to Krishna should have been dealt with more carefully. Instead of unnecessary scenes, the director should have focused more on this aspect and it would have made the climax even more appealing.
<h3>Others</h3>
Murali Sharma is adequate in his role, though he really doesn't seem as dangerous as his character is said to be. Brahmaji has a nice role in this movie that entertains and the scenes with Prudhviraj are also comical. While Satyam Rajesh's character was mildly enjoyable, it didn't really add much to the story and could have been removed from the movie without much loss. In fact, it would have been better if the director hadn't included these scenes and focused more on the character development later on.

<h3>Music</h3>

This movie is Vishal Chandrasekhar's first major Telugu film and he delivers a decent album. The situational songs and background score work really well with the movie and the song Nuvvante Na Navvu stands out with its lovely lyrics by Krishna Kanth and dramatic music. Ulikipadaku Ulikipadaku is an okay song to listen to, but felt really out of place in the movie; it was too fast paced for the situation and unnecessarily silly.
<h3>Cinematography</h3>
The visuals were, for the most part, a mix of cinematic and realistic, which worked really well for the overall feel of the movie and elevated the scenes that needed to be elevated.

<h2><span class="review_header">Final Verdict</span></h2>
With an average story and a screenplay that could have been more fast-paced, Krishnagadi Veera Prema Gadha has entertaining and heart-touching moments, but could have been developed even further with better editing and post-interval character development.

If you liked the screenplay and comedy of Express Raja but wanted a more rural backdrop with slower narration and a touching love story, this is the movie for you.
