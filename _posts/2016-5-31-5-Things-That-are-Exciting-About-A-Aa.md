The next big upcoming Telugu film release is A Aa. You've probably heard of it by now, but if you haven't, its a Trivikram romantic comedy starring Nithin and Samantha as the lead pair and boasting a soundtrack from Mickey J Meyer.

Here are five reasons why you should be excited about its release on June 2nd!

<h2><span class="review_header">5. Cinematography and Production</span></h2>

As you can see in the teaser above, A Aa has some beautiful visuals to display. The cinematographer, Natarajan Subramaniam, has some big movies in his credentials (Jab We Met, Love Aaj Kal and Raanjhanna to name a few), and it seems like he has put forth his best efforts for this film as well. A Aa is also being produced by S. Radha Krishna under the Haarika &amp; Hassine Creations banner, which also produced other hits like Julyai and S/O Satyamurthy and is also producing the Telugu remake of the Malayalam hit cinema, Premam. The production values look rich and its clear that, whatever the film is, it will be at least a pleasure to the eyes.

<h2><span class="review_header">4. Casting</span></h2>

The film is clearly focused on the two main characters of Anusuya Ramalingam, played by Samantha Ruth Prabhu, and Aanand Vihari, played by Nithin, who looks like he's back in form after no major hits in the past two years. This alone is a good pairing, but the film also displays an ensemble cast of seasoned actors like Naresh, Nadhiya (think Atha from Atharinitiki Daredi), Brahmanandam, Ali and Rao Ramesh, as well as young, talented actors like Srinival Avasarala (Astha Chamma, Oohallu Gusagusaladu, etc.) and Anupama Parameshwaran (Premam). This casting is already intriguing and I'm curious to see how all of them perform together on screen.

<h2><span class="review_header">3. Music</span></h2>

Mickey J Meyer has his own style of music direction and it seems to fit very well with A Aa if the teasers and promos are anything to go by. A Aa has an interesting mix of songs, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MALcPfRF4ek" target="_blank">Yaa Yaa</a>, a village song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySo5O2waS9o" target="_blank">Rang De</a>, a colorful, festive song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFj_RbKIzZ0" target="_blank">Anusuya Kosam</a>, a pop song sung by Karthik with a rap portion from the upcoming Telugu rapper Roll Rida, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1iIzJ6lWU" target="_blank">Mummy Returns</a>, a peppy situational song, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3ANY12L-eM" target="_blank">Yellipoke Shyamala</a>, a break up song that reminds me of Sailaja Sailaja from Nenu Sailaja but is different to its own accord. My personal favorites are Rang De and Anusuya Kosam; it's nice to hear some Telugu rap that actually sounds good for once.

<h2><span class="review_header">2. Trivikram Brand</span></h2>

After S.S. Rajamouli, Trivikram is the director in Telugu cinema with the best ratio of hit movies and a fan following among all audiences. His films have a certain charm and his clever, moving dialogues up the emotional ante. From Nuvve Nuvve to Athadu to Julayi, Trivikram has proven he can convey a diverse range of stories with the simplest of scenes. When it comes to A Aa, this is no different. Since Jalsa, Trivikram has been writing films that are specific to the actor playing the role of the protagonist. With A Aa, Trivikram is turning his focus back onto the story and this only raises the bar of expectations for the film.

<h2><span class="review_header">1. A Strong Female Protagonist</span></h2>

While Trivikram is a talented director and writer, he isn't perfect. One trend that I have noticed is his films have a tendency to have weak female protagonists paired with the stronger male protagonists. Let's go through each of his films and summarize the female protagonists:
<h3>Nuvve Nuvve</h3>
Anjali, played by Shriya, is a rich, pretty girl with childish antics. She's mainly there for the father - daughter sentiment and romance with the main character.
<h3>Athadu</h3>
Poori, played by Trisha, is the daughter of the family of Pardhu, the person who Nandu impersonates. She spends her time hitting on Nandu, thinking he is her cousin, and is there for Nandu to have a reason to continue impersonating Pardhu forever after he gives up his life of professional assassinations.
<h3>Jalsa</h3>
Bhagi (Ileana) and Jo (Parvati Melton) both fight in trying to become Sanjay's girlfriend because he fights well and saves them from ragging.
<h3>Khaleja</h3>
Subhashini (Anushka Shetty) is a quirky girl and a source of bad luck for Raju, but he eventually falls in love with her.
<h3>Julayi</h3>
Madhu (Ileana) is a helpless step-daughter. Ravi comes into her life and fixes everything.
<h3>Attarintiki Daredi</h3>
Sashi (Samantha) fights with the newly appointed car driver. It is later revealed that she fell in love with him at first sight.
<h3>S/O Satyamurthy</h3>
Sameera (Samantha) is a diabetic and the primary romantic interest of Viraj Anand.
<h3>A Aa</h3>
Anusuya Ramalingam vs. Aanand Vihari. Even from the name, it's clear that the two main characters are both equals in this film. The fact that the trailer is narrated by Anusuya shows her character's importance to the film. The last time a Trivikram story had two fighting protagonists who are equals and fall in love was Nuvvu Naku Nachav, which was a huge success and remains a fun watch to this day. That is why Trivikram having a strong female character for this film is the most exciting aspect of A Aa, because it is a sign that he has completely shifted his focus back from formulaic plots to simply telling a story.
