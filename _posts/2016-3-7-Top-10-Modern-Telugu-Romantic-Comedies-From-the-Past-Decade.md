I try not to favor one genre over another, but I always find myself coming back to romantic comedies when I sit down to re-watch a film. I mean who honestly doesn't like a funny, light-hearted love story? Alas, good straightforward romantic comedies are hard to find in Telugu, since so many films try to follow the formula method of including other elements, such as action or family drama, into the mix as well.

Here are ten of the best Telugu romantic comedies I've seen in the last ten years that deal with forward-thinking characters, modern relationships and endings that are almost too good to be true!

<strong>Note: The films are separated into categories and then ordered based on their release date. There is no relative ordering between the films and the list is not exhaustive; it is a list of my personal favorites of this genre from the films that I have seen within the last ten years.</strong>

<h3>Nuvvostanante Nenodantana</h3>
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HFysS2JNu1A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
Prabhu Deva's directorial debut, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuvvostanante_Nenoddantana" target="_blank">Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana</a> is a modern classic when it comes to Telugu romantic comedies and has been remade in multiple languages. Though it follows the cliché plot-line of fun-loving rich boy meets lovely village girl, the film still manages to enthrall its audience due to the lively performances of its star cast, lovely music score by Devi Sri Prasad and an engaging narration.

<h3>Ready</h3>
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DlLdPEA1I5c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

A blockbuster that has been successfully remade in Tamil and Hindi, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_(2008_film)" target="_blank">Ready</a> is a must watch for its comedy, songs (also by Devi Sri) and the cute chemistry between Ram and Genelia, who happen to be close friends in real life. While it may not be the first film to portray the guy resolving family feuds for the girl, it certainly keeps you entertained throughout.

<h3>Bommarillu</h3>
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wtVamXrcN_U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

With the number of parodies of this film's climax and the phrase "Bommarillu father" being used in households everywhere, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bommarillu" target="_blank">Bommarillu</a> is not only a good romantic comedy, its one of the best Telugu films of this decade in general. With a charming love story, touching family relations and yet another melodious soundtrack from Devi Sri Prasad, this movie has it all!

<h3>Bhale Bhale Magadivoy</h3>
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFU_vmnPw0M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

A movie that surprised everyone with its success, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhale_Bhale_Magadivoy" target="_blank">Bhale Bhale Magadivoy</a> is a love at first sight story about a guy who has memory problems and struggles to win his girl's hand in marriage. Nani's performance is effortless and his pairing with Lavanya results in a beautiful romance that is further enhanced with the catchy tunes by famous Malayali music director Gopi Sunder. Yet, the biggest plus point for this film is its situational comedy that will have you laughing till the happy ending.

<h3>Godavari</h3>
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/38PEDSKXxH4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The film that established Sekhar Kammula as more than just a one-hit wonder in directing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godavari_(film)" target="_blank">Godavari</a> depicts the tale of Ram and Seetha as they fall in love amidst the peaceful and scenic beauty of the Godavari river. With natural performances, relatable characters and emotions and classically influenced songs by K. M. Radha Krishnan, Godavari easily strikes a chord in its audience and leaves you feeling inspired about love and life in general.

<h3>Ala Modalaindi</h3>
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xTqNB07fQ9g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Speaking of ill-fate, the relationship between Nani and Nithya Menon in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ala_Modalaindi" target="_blank">Ala Modalaindi</a> will have you yelling at your screen as they wade through circumstances and other relationships while struggling to convey their feelings to each other. Nandini Reddy's promising directorial debut has a freshness in narration and characterization that elevates the film from a worthwhile watch to a must watch and it has successfully been remade in Bengali, Tamil and Kannada with a rumored Hindi remake in the works.

<h3>100% Love</h3>
<iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q0wjGBZ5yuU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

One of Sukumar's best films, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100%25_Love_(2011_film)" target="_blank">100% Love</a> portrays a fighting relationship between Balu and Mahalakshmi that brings bava maradalu love stories back into style. What differentiates this film from other films is its unique focus on academics, which Devi Sri Prasad (are you noticing a theme here?) masterfully utilizes in his soundtrack for the film. Though I believe the second half could have been dealt with better (as with most of Sukumar's movies), it still makes for a fun watch!

<h3>Oohalu Gusagusalade</h3>
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qe7WKQvuLf4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Everyone knew that Srinivas Avasarala was a talented performer on screen, but it wasn't until the release of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oohalu_Gusagusalade" target="_blank">Oohalu Gusagusalade</a> that we saw his mastery in the art of directing. This film takes a simple, pleasant love story with a handsome guy and a sweet girl and turns it into something mesmerizing, finding a special place in its audiences's hearts. In addition, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S72iG2IWEU8" target="_blank">Em Sandeham Ledu</a> is probably one of the best Telugu melodies in recent times and we can thank Kalyani Koduri for his soundtrack for this film. I'm really looking forward to Srinivas's next directorial film, Jyo Achyutananda, which he recently finished writing!

<h3>OK Bangaram</h3>
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/up9AR3ZCc7w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The most modern of all of the movies listed here, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Kadhal_Kanmani" target="_blank">OK Bangaram</a> is a Mani Ratnam brand film that artistically explores the concept of live-in relationships. Set in the urban backdrop of Mumbai, the movie is slow-paced, but its power lies not in its narration, but rather in its character development. A. R. Rahman's masterful music breathes life into this film, cementing its place on this list. This movie was also the Telugu debut for Dulquer Salmaan and I would love to see more of him in Telugu as he has an impeccable taste for selecting films (Bangalore Days anyone?).

<h3>Darling</h3>
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MuQ7UgX0OAM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Prabhas, who normally acts in action films, completely redefined his image with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_(2010_film)" target="_blank">Darling</a>, another successful romantic film by Karunakaran. This film stands out for its risky narration and strong emotional bonds that only grow stronger with time, and is G. V. Prakash's most popular album in Telugu. From Prabhas's loose shirts to the snow-covered Buddha statue in Hyderabad, Darling is full of unique moments that will make a lasting impression.

<h2><span class="review_header">Others Worth Mentioning</span></h2>
<h3>Happy Days</h3>
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Evjk-bXbEo0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
While it's not a romantic comedy in the traditional sense, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Days_(2007_film)" target="_blank">Happy Days</a> covers the love stories of four friends and has many heart touching moments as they learn and evolve over their four years at an engineering college.
<h3>Uyyala Jampala</h3>
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BBpGi5sdKWQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
Set in a village backdrop, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyyala_Jampala" target="_blank">Uyyala Jampala</a> is another good romantic comedy between bava and maradalu, with very natural performances and a simple idea of learning the value of someone only when you are about to lose them.
<h3>Nenu Sailaja</h3>
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i916BRRHoTg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
This year was a good start to the Telugu cinema industry with the success of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nenu_Sailaja" target="_blank">Nenu Sailaja</a>, another romantic comedy starring Ram. While the story is nothing new, the fresh direction of debutante Kishore Tirumala and the realistic, yet effective dialogues make a stylish impact. Devi Sri Prasad delivered another hit album with this movie and the sentiment between Sailaja, played well by debutante Keerthi Suresh, and her father is endearing to watch.
