    <br>

    <div class="block-title">SYNOPSIS</div>
    <br> An elderly couple, Raghava Raju (Prakash Raj) and Janakama (Jayasudha), are living alone in an ancestral village home after their three children have settled abroad in different countries and fail to visit them for many years.

    <div class="block-title">WHAT WORKED</div>
    <br>&nbsp; &ndash;  <i>{{ page.title }}</i>'s biggest strength is its emotional quotient that strengthens as the film progresses. Viewers who are abroad can easily connect with the nostalgia for childhood memories and the inability to spend more time with those who really matter back in India. While the plot is quite simple, it is effective and, having grown up in the U.S. myself, I could relate to the film a lot.
    <br><br>&nbsp; &ndash;  The dialogues are witty and meaningful and the scenes are clean and enteratining, making this a perfect Sankranthi film. 
    <br><br>&nbsp; &ndash; The casting for <i>{{ page.title }}</i> is pretty good; Prakash Raj and Jayasudha are perfect as the elderly couple who miss their children and Sharwanand fits well as the lovable and persuasive friend, family member and lover. Anupama Parameswaran is cute as the granddaughter who falls in love with the village atmosphere and her chemistry with Sharwanand works really well. Naresh also delviers a funny, yet touching performance as Sharwanand's father. 
    <br><br>&nbsp; &ndash; The film covers the festivities and village scenery in beautiful frames and Mickey J. Meyer's background music and songs are apt for the film's content.
    <br><br>&nbsp; &ndash; Satish Vegesna had a good idea of what he wanted the film to be like and was successfsul. There are no unneccessary or poorly developer comedy tracks, only natural comedy and relatable characters and emotions.

    <div class="block-title">WHAT DIDN'T</div>
    <br>&nbsp; &ndash; The narration of the film is slow and mellow, so the it might not appeal to all viewers. 
    <br><br>&nbsp; &ndash; There are a couple of scenes that could have been shortened to help the screenplay feel crisper and remove any sense of drag; more stringent editing could have easily alleviated this mild issue.
