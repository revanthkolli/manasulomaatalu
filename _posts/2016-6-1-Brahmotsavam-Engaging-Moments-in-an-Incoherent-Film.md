Brahmotsavam needs no introduction; it was the most awaited film of the year and had a plethora of expectations to meet after the tremendous box office success of Mahesh's previous film, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srimanthudu" target="_blank">Srimanthudu</a>. It opened to negative reviews and there have been numerous articles claiming that Brahmotsavam is officially the biggest disaster of the year.

Is the movie really that terrible? How could a movie starring almost all of the biggest actors and character artists in the Telugu film industry get such negative reviews? Read the review below to find out!

<h2><span class="review_header">Katha, Screenplay, Darsakathvam</span></h2>
<span style="color:#808080;">I don’t believe in spoiling the plot of a film before watching it. If you haven’t seen the movie yet and would like to know the plot, you can read more about it <a style="color:#808080;" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5457722/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl" target="_blank">here</a>.</span>

The director of the film, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srikanth_Addala" target="_blank">Srikanth Addala</a>, has a certain style to his films that is very identifiable. Brahmotsavam is no different, and is very similar to Srikanth and Mahesh's previous collaboration, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seethamma_Vakitlo_Sirimalle_Chettu" target="_blank">Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu</a>. Addala prefers simple stories and a very laid back style of narration that, understandably, feels slow for some people. Nevertheless, Brahmotsavam does indeed have a central conflict that it revolves around. The only problem is that it is hard to follow, because the film doesn't focus on this issue and jumps from place to place, interjecting ideas and scenes that are interesting, but don't really add any value to the story. Where Addala excels is in developing engaging and out-of-the-box characters that stand out from other films. From the grumpiness of Rao Ramesh's character to the oddity that is Samantha's character (the characters are not named, which happens a lot in Addala's films), the characters are what keep the audience's interest in the film. If it weren't for this, I'm sure the film would have been an even bigger disaster.

Traditionally, all films follow a simple structure of story telling where they start off at a stasis before the central conflict is revealed. The film then moves forward and eventually ends with some sort of new stasis in place. As I mentioned before, Brahmotsavam does indeed have this structure, but it is so hard to understand because the film entertains too many minor plots and scenes that are well made, but that don't add any value to the core of the film. Essentially, the film feels as if Addala knew what he wanted to show the audience, but wasn't really sure how to do so. This is the biggest drawback of the film. Perhaps, if the director had fleshed out the connections of the story, the final output would have flowed better.
<h2><span class="review_header">Performances</span></h2>
<h3>Mahesh</h3>
Mahesh has definitely been improving with every film he does. He emotes really well in the film and the emotional sequences are very heartful. It was a treat to see him play a charming young man on a journey to find the meaning behind his father's beliefs.
<h3>Sathyaraj</h3>
Sathyaraj is clearly a very talented actor and he handles the role of Mahesh's character's father with ease. The whole film really centers around his character's belief that all we need in life is to be surrounded with people who we can call our own, and if we can do that, every day can be a celebration.
<h3>Rao Ramesh</h3>
Rao Ramesh is the highlight of the film. His subtle expressions of jealousy and discomfort easily stand out amidst the festive atmosphere and upbeat attitudes of the other characters in the film, and he shows nuances in his character with an ease that comes from talent and experience.
<h3>Samantha</h3>
Just when I thought the film was getting boring, Samantha's character entered and brought much needed comic relief. Samantha plays the care-free character who matches Mahesh's character's personality aptly, though, like everything else in the film, it could have been fleshed out more. While her entrance in the film is fun, it is feels somewhat random, as does her exit.
<h3>Others</h3>
Kajal is another notable actress in the film and plays her role of a matured girl from Australia visiting her parents fairly well. The chemistry between Kajal and Mahesh works so well, it's a shame it doesn't last. There are a number of other seasoned actors and actresses in this film and they all do an adequate job; the sheer quantity of actors and their solid performances make the whole idea of the film believable.

<h2><span class="review_header">Production Values</span></h2>
<h3>Music</h3>

Mickey J Meyer's soundtrack for the film is adequate and works well on screen, though a few of the songs sound similar to those of this previous film tracks and don't work as well off screen. Bala Tripuramani is easily the catchiest of all of the songs.

Gopi Sundar's background score also works well for the film and helps ease some of the jarring transitions. I do wonder why they split the background music and soundtrack among two different directors this way though.
<h3>Cinematography</h3>

R. Rathnavelu has done some fantastic work in previous films like 1 - Nenokkadine and Enthiran and his efforts in Brahmotsavam don't go unnoticed. The film has rich production values with vibrant colors and enticing locations from all across India.

<h2><span class="review_header">Final Verdict</span></h2>
Lots of hype, a wonderful cast, interesting characters and rich production values and songs all make Brahmotsavam a watchable film, despite its obvious flaws in narration. It's hard to make good films that are also offbeat and unorganized, but I can't help but wonder how much better the outcome could have been if Srikanth Addala had just fleshed out the structure and flow of the story more.
<h3>Parent's Verdict</h3>
Mahesh romances multiple women in this film and this includes short kiss scenes and some jokes that kids won't understand. There is a portion of a song in which Mahesh and Samantha are seen partying and taking multiple shots until they get drunk and wake up with a hangover. There is also a scene involving the death of a child who is terminally ill and knows that she is going to die. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this movie for kids, because there's just not much entertainment in it for them; it's hard enough for adults to follow and understand.
