    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Ekkadiki-Pothavu-Chinnavada/"><h4> Ekkadiki Pothavu Chinnavada </h4>
    <div class="img-cover"><div class="img-preview" style="background-image: url('../img/ekkadiki_pothavu_chinnavada_poster.jpg');"></div></div></a>
    A small movie that smashed the box office by surprise, Ekkadiki Pothavu Chinnavada is a refreshing addition to the horror-comedy genre. With a cast of some of the most popular upcoming Telugu film industry aritsts, upbeat music and a script to match, how could this movie not be intriguing? 
    <br><br>
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Premam/"><h4> Premam </h4>
    <div class="img-cover"><div class="img-preview" style="background-image: url('../img/premam_poster.jpg');"></div></div></a>
    The Malayalam modern classic was remade in Telugu and mesmerized the audience despite the initial backlash against fans who didn't believe the cast was up for the challenge. Despite the familarity of the story, the entertaining narration, wonderful lead performances and beautiful music make this a must watch. 
    <br><br>
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Gentleman-Suspenseful-Love-Stories/"><h4> Gentleman </h4>
    <div class="img-cover"><div class="img-preview" style="background-image: url('../img/gentleman_poster.jpg');"></div></div></a>
    Nani is possibly the most popular rising star of the Telugu film industry and it makes sense why. He's been on a roll ever since <i>Bhale Bhale Magadivoy</i> last year and, out of his three releases this year, <i>Gentleman</i> is certainly the best. Gripping suspense, catchy tunes and the debut of Niveda Thomas make this one memorable.
    <br><br>
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/A-Aa-Another-Feel-Good-Trivikram-Family-Entertainer/"><h4> A Aa </h4>
    <div class="img-cover"><div class="img-preview" style="background-image: url('../img/a_aa_poster.jpg');"></div></div></a>
    The most successful Telugu film of 2016 in the overseas market, <i> A Aa </i> showed Trivikram's brand power at the box office despite the absence of a major leading star - or, at least, that's what other websites have been saying. Samantha is at the primer of her career though and this film is her show throughout as she charms the audience in this portrayal of the classic novel and remake of the yesteryear film, <i> Meena </i>.

    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Soggade-Chinni-Nayana-Extended-Film-Review/"><h4> What Does the Success of Soggade Chinni Nayana Say About Our Society? </h4>
    <div class="img-cover"><div class="img-preview" style="background-image: url('../img/soggade_chinni_nayana_poster.jpg');"></div></div></a>
    The movie review that started it all, this was the first review that we published and received positive feedback from. While many other reviews have praised <i> Soggade Chinni Nayana </i> for it's "entertainment", our review took a different approach, analyzing the reasons behind why the Telugu audience found this movie entertaining despite its misogyny. Read the article to find out why we deserve better from seasoned and respected actors like Nagarjuna who have a large influence on the youth.
