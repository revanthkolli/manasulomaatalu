Have you ever read a movie review and wondered how the film critic comes up with the magical number that determines the film's value?

So have I.

One of the reasons Manasulo Maatalu was created was to provide quality reviews for South Indian films. In order to support these film reviews and make the process more transparent, a friend recommended that I explain the reasoning behind the five point rating system that is used and break it down into the different components that make up a film.

<h2><span class="review_header">Why Use a Rating System at All? </span></h2>
There are arguments out there as to why films need to be rated at all. After all, a film review is supposed to provide analysis for a film and simply attributing a number or percentage to a film can undermine all of the effort and hard work that was put into making it. Manasulo Maatalu uses a rating system in order to help readers compare films and determine whether a given film is worth the investment in a shorter time; often times, readers don't have time to read the whole review and want a simpler alternative or need to be reminded of the film's merits and don't want to re-read a whole review.
<h3>Why Use a Five Point System?</h3>
While there are multiple ways to rate films, a five point rating system is possibly the most widely used and easily understood. Each point is broken down into four, so points are awarded in intervals of .25 (i.e. .25, .5, .75, 1, etc.). This break down makes it easier to provide consistent ratings while still making it easy to understand where the rating comes from. Every film is different, so the points are attributed to the potential that the film has in that particular category and the extent to which it reaches that potential.

<h3>1. Story and Characterization</h3>
An engaging story is the very backbone of a film. A film's primary purpose is to tell its viewers a story. Creating strong, identifiable characters is an effective way to keep a film's viewers engaged. This is why story and characterization combine to form one point in the five point rating system. Films that have a weak story that doesn't flow or characters that are one sided and underdeveloped tend to earn less of the point value.
<h3>2. Screenplay and Pacing</h3>
Screenplay, as used here, is defined as the way in which the story of the film is delivered to the audience. This involves many things, such as the order of the major events of the film, the use of techniques like foreshadowing and flashbacks, etc. Pacing is very related to this concept and describes the progression of the film as the events move forward. While they are related, they still attribute different aspects of films and are, therefore, used to compose another point in the system. Films that have weak screenplay with unnecessarily complicated or confusing ordering of events or films that have pacing that is either too slow or too fast for the given content will earn less of the point value.
<h3>3. Technical Values (i.e. Music, Cinematography)</h3>
A film's technical values can have a very strong influence on the overall experience of watching the film. There are a number of films that have amazing visuals or soundtracks that elevate the otherwise mediocre stories, making the overall cinema experience even better. This is why music, cinematography and animation, for films that it applies to, are all attributed to make up another point in the system.
<h3>4. Performances</h3>
A film can have a uniquely gripping story with a fresh soundtrack and apt visuals, but still fail to gain the appreciation of viewers because of weak performances from its artists. This is why the fourth point of the system is used to determine the performances of the major artists of the film.
<h3>5. The Fifth Point</h3>
So far, four of the five points in the system have been attributed to the various components that make up a film. The great thing about this five point rating system is that there is no fifth point! This allows for greater flexibility in rating films because, often, we find ourselves watching films that have exceptional qualities that make up for the other aspects that the film might be lacking. For example, a film can have wonderful performances from its cast members that make up for the slower screenplay or inadequate plot. In such cases, not having a fifth point leaves four extra .25 points that can be attributed the components that are exceptional and make up for the other lacking categories.

I hope understanding the way the Manasulo Maatalu film rating system works will help you make better use of the reviews that are written here. I also hope that this article will give you a better appreciation for Manasulo Maatalu reviews as a whole, because the ratings are not merely picked off of a whim; there is an actual process and analysis behind the reviews and ratings that are published.
