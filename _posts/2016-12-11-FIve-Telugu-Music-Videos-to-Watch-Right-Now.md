<p>Keeravani, Devi Sri Prasad, Thaman, Gopi Sundar. If you think Telugu music is only limited to these names and are craving some fresh tunes, you need to watch these five music videos right now!</p>
<h2><span class="review_header">Enduke</span></h2>
<h3>Rahul Silpigunj</h3>

<p>Smooth chords, a pleasant voice and a catchy tune make Enduke instantly likeable. Rahul Silpigunj is a playback singer who's trying to make a name for himself by producing private music videos, and Enduke is easily one of his best. If you've ever been through a broken relationship, then you should check this one out!</p>
<h2>Em Maayalo</h2>
<h3>Rahul Silpigunj</h3>

<p>Love strikes when you least expect it - That's how Rahul's Em Maayalo starts and it'll find its own place in your heart once you've heard its tune. The lyrics are penned beautifully Vengi, who also penned Rahul's Enduke; it seems like Rahul's learned a lesson or two on how to make hit songs from singing so many of them.</p>
<h2>Jimpak Chipak</h2>
<h3>MC Mike, MC Uneek, Sunny Austin & Om Sripathi</h3>

<p>Hyderabadi mass rap. That basically sums up this really catchy collaboration by MC Mike, MC Uneek, Sunny Austin and Om Sripathi, four indepenent Telugu rappers. The song went viral and has more than 7 million views on YouTube til date. It might not be your cup of chai, but it's worth checking out!</p>
<h2>Neeve</h2>
<h3>Phani Kalyan, Yazin Nazir & Sameera Bharadwaj</h3>

<p>Phani Kalyan's recent viral hit, Neeve, is beautifully choregraphed by Vishwakiran Nambi and is the perfect blend of classical and western styles. Released in Tamil, Telugu and Kannada, the romantic dance video starring Shreya Deshpande and Niranjan Harish recently surpassed a million views for the Telugu version. If you haven't seen it yet, watch it once and you'll keep coming back!</p>
<h2>Chandamama</h2>
<h3>Phani Kalyan, Yazin Nazir & Manasi M.M.</h3>

<p>After taking the media by storm with Neeve, Phani Kalyan quickly followed up with the pleasand melody, Chandamama. Props to him for his consistent success! Filmed in beautiful locations, the song seems dreamy and stars Arjun Kalyan and Pujita Ponnada, a pair of popular actors in Telugu short films. Check out the song and then check out some of their short films while you're at it!</p>

<p>Private music production should be a bigger deal in Telugu and other Indian languages because it allows for more musical variety and freedom. Besides, more music is hardly a bad thing. These are just five of my favorites that I wanted to share; there are some more songs out there from these and other artists. Feel free to share your own favorites in the comments!</p>
