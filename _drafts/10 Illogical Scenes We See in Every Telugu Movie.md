    <div class="block-title">TL;DR</div>
    <br>
    There's no doubt that Telugu movies have been become more diverse and entertaining in recent years, but certain illogical elements still persist and it drives me crazy every time I see them. Here's a list of some of the most annoying ones.

<div class="block">
    <div class="block-title">EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE</div>
    <br>
    <h4> Subservient Friends </h4>
    I understand, the protagonist is heroic and needs to be put in a spotlight, but does he (or she) really need to abuse their friends so much? All the unnecessary slapping and verbal abuse makes it seem like they are servants, not friends.

    <h4> Physical Abuse to Show Dominance </h4>
    Telugu movies have a repuation for good comedy, but in recent years every movie seems to implement comedy in its most crude form: physical abuse of a comedic character to show the dominance of a protagonist. Violence isn't funny. Blackmail isn't funny. There's a difference between slapstick comedy and plain violence, but why do the same jokes keep coming up? Can't writers and directors think of something more creative like they did in the old days when the comedy in Telugu films had more class or, at the very least, was genuine?

    <h4> Unreasonable Fights </h4>
    This is a hard one to argue about because it is hard to be creative when it comes to showing how a protagonist overcomes a seemingly indefeatable foe (which happens a lot in Telugu movies). My main problem here is with how these scenes are depicted with minimal realism. Give the protagonist a back story and a reason for how he or she is able to do what he or she does. Use realistic fight sequences from the various forms of fighting and martial arts that exist in the world to make the scenes more relatable. It's easy to say that the protagonist suddenly has super powers, but putting the effort to make the backstory is what making the film is about, right?

    <h4> Mixing the Actor With the Character </h4>
    I understand, the protagonist is heroic and needs to be put in a spotlight, but does he (or she) really need to abuse their friends so much? All the unnecessary slapping and verbal abuse makes it seem like they are servants, not friends.
